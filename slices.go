	//SLICES - References to underlying arrays, they do not store any data themseleves but provide a window into the array's elements, slices can grow and shrink dynamically

	// function len to check the length of the slice

	// function cap to check the capacity of the slice, it will check the number of elements in the underlying array, starting from the slices first element.

	// To initialize slice using make
