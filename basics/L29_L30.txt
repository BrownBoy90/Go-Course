// When developing Real world software, efficiency in deployment becomes crucial
// rather than repeatedly compiling our program we compile it once and store the 
// for future executions, this process is achieved using go build command
// Works in terminal 
// go build name_of_file.go
// To run it
// ./name_of_file

// L30 - Go Run

// go run does not make a persistent exec file
